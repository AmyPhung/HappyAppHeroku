# HappyApp
This is a fun app made by Emma, Ever, and Amy at HackHolyoke2018. 

We're interested in making our friends happy! We identified a problem that anyone can relate to. Sometimes, our friends are just a bit sad. Could be a failed project, the stress of work not being finished, or anything else that makes our friends sad. 

We don't like seeing our friends sad, so we've created HappyApp! HappyApp is an online webapp hosted by HerokuApp with a python backend. On the webapp, simply type in your friend's email and hit the happy button to send your friend a surprise wholesome email! They'll never expect such positivity in their inbox!
